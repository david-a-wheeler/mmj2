 Suppose we have input "ax-mp" in the 'qed' step while proving
 theorem "syl" and that we pressed Ctrl-U to unify. Here is the
 output of the Derive Feature:

h1::syl.1          |- ( ph -> ps )
h2::syl.2          |- ( ps -> ch )
1002:?:            |- &W1
2002:?:            |- ( &W1 -> ( ph -> ch ) )
qed:1002,2002:ax-mp     |- ( ph -> ch )

* Now we realize that step 1002 is really step 1, so we input
  a "Local Ref" in the Ref field of step 2002, like this:

           1002:?:#syl.1      |- &W1

        or

           1002:?:#1          |- &W1

* Ok, make that update to step 2002 above and press Ctrl-U
  to see what happens -- then use Edit/Undo twice to return
  to this page just prior to the Ctrl-U.

* What happened is that the program did a little "text editing"
  to delete step 2002 and change the 'qed' step's Hyp to point
  to step 1 instead of 2002, resulting in a proof steps that
  look like this (except not indented):

           h1::syl.1          |- ( ph -> ps )
           h2::syl.2          |- ( ps -> ch )
           2002:?:            |- ( ( ph -> ps ) -> ( ph -> ch ) )
           qed:1,2002:ax-mp     |- ( ph -> ch )

* That is what the "Local Ref" feature does. It is just a
  "text editing" short-cut for "power users" :-)

* NOTE In the event of the Local Ref was input incorrectly,
       or if there is a subsequent error, say during Unification,
       then the user has the option of either manually
       correcting the proof *or* using Edit/Undo to restore the
       Proof Worksheet to the pre-*text editing* state. And, as
       is the case today, if mmj2 detects an error during the
       Load Worksheet validation phase, the input Proof Worksheet
       is redisplayed without any of the program's updates to the
       data (processing halts immediately during "Load Worksheet"
       execution if an error is found and no changes are made.)
