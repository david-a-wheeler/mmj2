 Press Ctrl-U and watch the "Derive Feature" in action!

h1::reiteration.1  |- ph
1001:?:            |- &W1
2001:?:            |- ( &W1 -> ph )
qed:1001,2001:ax-mp |- ph

*The Derive Feature took our formula from the "qed" step, "|- ph", and
 unified it with Assertion ax-mp and an "unknown" Hyp. Since we gave
 Derive no hypotheses and ax-mp uses two hypotheses, Derive generated
 two Hypothesis steps for us that match ax-mp's hypotheses.

     1001:?:            |- &W1
     2001:?:            |- ( &W1 -> ph )

 Note that we only gave Derive one variable, "ph", and ax-mp uses two
 variables, so Derive substituted a "Work Variable", "&W1" for the
 missing variable. We could modify "&W1" and change it to any valid
 wff variable or expression (work variables are "meta-metavariables"
 -- you can read about them here at mmj2\doc\WorkVariables.html).

 Or, observe that the generated step, 1001 has a formula that looks
 suspiciously similar to our hypothesis, step 1. So we use Edit/Undo
 (twice) to return the screen to its pre-Unification condition. Then
 set the "qed" step's Step:Hyp:Ref field to "qed:1,?:ax-mp", and then
 press Ctrl-U. Try it!

 OK, forward to the next Tutorial page (Page406.mmp)!
