 In this scenario we will give the Derive Feature one known
 Hypothesis, step 1, plus one unknown hypothesis ("?") because we
 found out that ax-mp uses two Logical Hypotheses and one of them is
 very similar to our hypothesis! Press Ctrl-U and watch the "Derive
 Feature" in action!

 Wow! I want to see that again in slo-mo? What just happened?!?!!!

 First, Derive took our Hypothesis and "qed" formula, and unified them
 with ax-mp, producing the following variable substitutions: "ph" for
 "ph" and "ph" for "ps". Then it used those to *derive* the missing
 Hypothesis step using ax-mp's "maj" Logical Hypothesis as a template.
 Step 1001 resulted! Then, to be extra helpful, Derive went ahead and
 attempted unification of the new Derivation step, 1001. Success! The
 new step 1001 unifies with Assertion "id". Then Unification proceeded
 normally and discovered the proof to be complete! Yay!!!

 OK, forward to the next Tutorial page (Page407.mmp)!
